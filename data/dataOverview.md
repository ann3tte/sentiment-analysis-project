# DATASET OVERVIEW ðŸ“Š
All datasets have been processed to keep only the text and the label. Additionally, they have all been shuffled. 
The amazon dataset has also been limited to 50k samples and balanced perfectly across labels. The tweets and 
youtube datasets have not been limited or balanced in any way.
